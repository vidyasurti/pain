					<p>Surely he will not abandon me, the mighty oracle of Loxias, who urged me to

						warmth of my heart, if I do not take vengeance on my father's murderers. He
						said that, enraged by the loss of my possessions, I should kill them in
						requital just as they killed. And he declared that otherwise I should pay
						the debt myself with my own life, after many grievous sufferings. For he
						spoke revealing to mortals the wrath of malignant powers from underneath the
						earth, and telling of plagues: leprous ulcers that mount with fierce fangs
						on the fleshand eat away its primal nature; and how a white down should
						sprout up on the diseased place. And he spoke of other assaults of the
						Furies that are destined to be brought to pass from paternal blood. For the
						dark bolt of the infernal powers, who are stirred by kindred victims calling
						for vengeance, and madness, and groundless terrors out of the night, torment
						and harass a man, and he sees clearly, though he moves his eyebrows in the
						dark.And with his body marred by the brazen scourge, he is even chased in
						exile from his country.And the god declared that to such as these it is not
						allowed to have a part either in the ceremonial cup or in the cordial
						libation; his father's wrath, though unseen, bars him from the altar; no one
						receives him or lodges with him; and at last, despised by all, friendless,
						he perishes,shrivelled pitifully by a death that wastes him utterly
						away.</p>
					<!-- This is about revenge, not pain -->

							authname="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>,just as I ended my journey
						here, a man, a stranger to me as I to him, fell in with me, and inquired

						you are bound for <placeName key="perseus,Argos" authname="perseus,Argos"
							>Argos</placeName>,keep my message in mind most faithfully and tell his
						parents Orestes is dead, and by no means let it escape you. Whether his

				<stage>Orestes with the branch and wreath of a suppliant is disclosed standing by
					the bodies. With him are Pylades and attendants who display the robe of
					Agamemnon</stage>
				<sp>
					<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
					<p>
						<pain>Behold this pair, oppressors of the land, who murdered my father and
							ransacked my house! They were majestic then, when they sat on their
							thrones,and are lovers even now, as one may judge by what has happened
							to them, and their oath holds true to their pledges. Together they vowed
							a league of death against my unhappy father, and together they vowed to
							die, and they have kept their promise well.</pain>
					</p>
					<p>But now regard again, you who hear this account of ills,<pain>the device for
							binding my unhappy father, with which his hands were manacled, his feet
							fettered</pain>. Spread it out! Stand around in a circle, and display
						this covering for a man, that the Father may see—not mine, but he who
						surveys all this, the Sun—that he may see the impious work of my own mother,
						that he may be my witness in court that I justly pursued this death, my own
						mother's. For I do not speak of Aegisthus' death: he has suffered the
						penalty prescribed for adulterers.</p>
					<p>But she who devised this abhorrent deed against her husband, whose children
						she bore, a burden under her belt, a burden once dear, but now a hateful
						ill, as it seems: what do you think of her? Had she been born a seasnake or
						a viper, I think her very touch without her bite would have caused anyone
						else to rot,if shamelessness and an immoral disposition could do
							so.<stage>He again takes up the bloody robe</stage></p>
					<p>What name shall I give it, however tactful I may be? A trap for a wild beast?
						Or a shroud for a corpse in his bier, wrapped around his feet? No, rather it
						is a net: you might call it a hunting net, or robes to entangle a man's
						feet.This would be the kind of thing a highwayman might posses, who deceives
						strangers and earns his living by robbery, and with this cunning snare he
						might kill many men and warm his own heart greatly.</p>
					<p>May such a woman not live with me in my house!Before that may the gods grant
						me to perish childless!</p>
				</sp>
				<sp>
					<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
					<p>
						<pain>Alas! Alas! Sorrowful work! You were done in by a wretched death.
							Alas! Alas! And for the survivor also suffering blossoms.</pain>
					</p>
				</sp>
				<sp>
					<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
					<p>Did she do the deed or not?No, this is my witness, dyed by Aegisthus' sword.
						This is a stain of blood that helps time to spoil the many tinctures of
						embroidered fabric.</p>
					<p>Now at last I speak his praises. Now at last I am present to lament him, as I
						address this web that wrought my father's death.Yet I grieve for the deed
						and the punishment and for my whole clan. My victory is an unenviable
						pollution.</p>
				</sp>
				<sp>
					<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
					<p>No mortal being shall pass his life unscathed, free from all suffering to the
						end. Alas! Alas! One tribulation comes today, another tomorrow.</p>
				</sp>
				<sp>
					<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
					<p>But since I would have you know, for I do not know how it will end: I think I
						am a charioteer driving my team far beyond the course. For my ungoverned
						wits are whirling me away overmastered, and at my heart fear wishes to sing
						and dance to a tune of wrath.But while I am still in my senses, I proclaim
						to those who hold me dear and declare that not without justice did I slay my
						mother, the unclean murderess of my father, and a thing loathed by the
						gods.</p>
					<p>And for the spells that gave me the courage for this deed I count Loxias, the
						prophet of <placeName key="tgn,7010770" authname="tgn,7010770"
							>Pytho</placeName>,my chief source. It was he who declared that, if I
						did this thing, I would be acquitted of wrongdoing. But if I refrained—I
						will not name the penalty; for no bowshot could reach such a height of
						anguish.</p>
					<p>And now observe me, how armed with this branch and wreath I go as a
						suppliant, an outcast for the shedding of kindred blood, to the temple set
						square on the womb of the earth,the precinct of Loxias, and to the bright
						fire said to be imperishable. To no other hearth did Loxias bid me turn. And
						as to the manner in which this evil deed was wrought, I charge all men of
							<placeName key="perseus,Argos" authname="perseus,Argos"
							>Argos</placeName> in time to come to bear me witness.I go forth a
						wanderer, estranged from this land, leaving this repute behind, in life or
						death.</p>
				</sp>
				<sp>
					<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
					<p>And you have done well. Therefore do not yoke your tongue to an ill-omened
						speech, nor let your lips give vent to evil forebodings,since you have freed
						the whole realm of <placeName key="perseus,Argos" authname="perseus,Argos"
							>Argos</placeName> by lopping off the heads of two serpents with a
						fortunate stroke.</p>
				</sp>
				<sp>
					<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
					<p>Ah, ah! You handmaidens, look at them there: like Gorgons, wrapped in sable
						garments, entwined with swarming snakes! I can stay no longer.</p>
				</sp>
				<sp>
					<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
					<p>What fantasies disturb you, dearest of sons to your father? Wait, do not be
						all overcome by fear.</p>
				</sp>
				<sp>
					<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
					<p>To me these are no imagined troubles. For there indeed are the hounds of
						wrath to avenge my mother.</p>
				</sp>
				<sp>
					<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
					<p>It is that the blood is still fresh on your hands;this is the cause of the
						disorder that assails your wits.</p>
				</sp>
				<sp>
					<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
					<p>O lord Apollo, look! Now they come in troops, and from their eyes they drip
						loathsome blood!</p>
				</sp>
				<sp>
					<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
					<p>There is one way to cleanse you: the touch of Loxias will set you free from
						this affliction.</p>
				</sp>
				<sp>
					<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
					<p>You do not see them, but I see them. I am pursued. I can stay no
							longer.<stage>Rushes out</stage></p>
				</sp>
				<sp n="chorus">
					<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
					<p>Then may blessings go with you, and may the god watch benevolently over you
						and guard you with favorable fortunes!</p>
					<p>Look! Now again, for the third time, has the tempest of this clan burst on
						the royal house and run its course.<pain>First, at the beginning, came the
							cruel woes of children slain for food; next, the fate of a man, a
							king,when the warlord of the Achaeans perished, murdered in his bath.
							And now, once again, there has come from somewhere a third, a deliverer,
							or shall I say a doom? Oh when will it finish its work, when will the
							fury of calamity, lulled to rest, find an end and cease?</pain></p>
