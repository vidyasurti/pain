               now that I have come to this
               						land and returned from exile. On this mounded grave I cry out to my father
               						to hearken, to hear me
               </a></p>
         <p><a href="#eventpain_0002" id="event-pain_0002">
               I think my own sister Electra is
               						approaching, distinguished by her bitter grief
               </a></p>
         <p><a href="#eventpain_0003" id="event-pain_0003">
               My cheek is marked with bloody gashes
               							where my nails have cut fresh furrows. And yet through all my life my
               							heart is fed with lamentation. Rips are torn by my griefs through the
               							linen web of my garment, torn in the cloth that covers my breast, the
               							cloth of robes struck for the sake of my mirthless
               							misfortunes.
               </a></p>
         <p><a href="#eventpain_0004" id="event-pain_0004">
               O mother Earth, she sends me forth,
               							godless woman that she is. But I am afraid to utter the words she
               							charged me to speak. For what atonement is there for blood fallen to
               							earth? Ah, hearth of utter grief! Ah, house laid low in ruin! Sunless
               							darkness, loathed by men, enshrouds our house due to the death of its
               							master.
               </a></p>
         <p><a href="#eventpain_0005" id="event-pain_0005">
               it is fitting for me to govern my bitter hate, even
               							against my will, and submit to the wishes of my masters, whether just or
               							unjust.
               </a></p>
         <p><a href="#eventpain_0006" id="event-pain_0006">
               Shall I
               						say that I bring these offerings to a loved husband from a loving wife—from
               						my own mother? I do not have the assurance for that, nor do I know what I
               						should say as I pour this libation onto my father's tomb. Or shall I speak
               						the words that men are accustomed to use: “To those who send these honors
               						may he return benefits”—a gift, indeed, to match their evil?
               </a></p>

         <p><a href="#eventpain_0008" id="event-pain_0008">
               who in exchange got as her mate Aegisthus, who was her

               Orestes is an outcast from his inheritance, while they
               						in their insolence revel openly in the winnings of your toil. But that
               						Orestes may come home with good fortune I pray to you, father: Oh, hearken
               						to me! And as for myself, grant that I may prove far more circumspect than
               						my mother and more reverent in deed.

               Over my

               Nor yet in truth did she clip it from her head, the
               						murderess, my own mother,who has assumed a godless spirit regarding her
               						children that ill accords with the name of mother

               						the orphaned brood of a father eagle that perished in the meshes, in the
               						coils of a fierce viper. They are utterly orphaned, gripped by the famine of
               						hunger: for they are not grown to full strength to bring their father's
               						quarry to the nest. So you see both me and poor Electra here, children
               						bereft of their father, both outcasts alike from our home

               						in the spirit of glory, should not be subjected so to a pair of
               						women

               your two children mourn you in a dirge
               							over your tomb. As suppliants and exiles as well they have sought a
               							haven at your sepulchre. What of these things is good, what free of
               							evil? Is it not hopeless to wrestle against doom?

               							Lycian spearman! Then you would have left a good name for your children
               							in their halls, and in their maturity you would have made their lives
               							admired by men. And in a land beyond the sea you would have found a tomb
               							heaped high with earth, no heavy burden for your house to
               							bear—
