               <p>You must cheat the mind of Philoctetes by means of a storytold as you converse with him. When he asks you who
						and from where you are, say that you are the son of Achilles—it is not in
						that detail that you will cheat him. But tell him you are sailing homeward,
						and have left the fleet of the Achaean warriors, after coming to hate them
						with unbounded hatred.Give him this
						reason: when, with no other hope of taking <placeName key="tgn,7002329" authname="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, they had summoned you by their
						prayers to come from home, they judged you not worthy of the arms of
						Achilles, not worthy to receive them—even though you had come and were
						claiming them by right—but instead handed them over to Odysseus. Say what
							youwill of me—even the vilest of
						vile insults. You will not harm me at all by that. But if you fail to do as
						I say, you will inflict pain on all the Argives, for if that man's bow is
						not seized, you can never sack the realm of Dardanus.And learn why your intercourse with him may be free
						from mistrust and danger, while mine cannot. You have sailed to <placeName key="perseus,Troy" authname="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> under no
						oath to any man, nor under any constraint. Neither did you have any part in
						the earlier expedition. I, however, can deny none of these things.
						Accordingly, if heperceives me while
						he is still master of his bow, I am dead, and you, as my comrade, will share
						my doom. No, the thing for which we must devise a ruse is just this: how you
						may steal his invincible weapons. Well I know, my son, that by nature you
						are not aptto utter or contrive such
						treachery. Yet knowing that victory is a sweet prize to gain, steel yourself
						to do it. Our honesty shall be displayed another time. Now, however, give
						yourself to me for one brief, shameless day, and then for the rest of
							timemay you be called the most
						righteous of all humankind.</p>

               <p>They came for me in a ship elaborately ornamented, shining Odysseus, and he
						who fostered my father,and
						said—whether truly or falsely, I do not know—that since my father had
						perished, fate now forbade that anyone but I should take the towers of
							<placeName key="perseus,Troy" authname="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.
						Saying that this, my friend, was how things stood, they caused me no long
						delay before I set sail in haste,chiefly because of my yearning for the dead, that I might look upon him
						before burial, since I had never seen him. Then, besides, theirs was a fine
						promise, if by accompanying them I might sack the towers of <placeName key="perseus,Troy" authname="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</p>
               <p>It was now the second day of my voyagewhen, sped by breeze and oar, I approached bitter Sigeum. When I landed,
						straightaway the entire army thronged around me with greetings, vowing that
						they saw their lost Achilles once more alive. He, though, lay ready for
						burial, and I, unhappy,when I had
						wept for him, went before long to the Atreids, to friends, as it was
						reasonable to suppose,—and claimed my father's arms and all else that had
						been his. O, their reply was bold and shameless! ‘Seed of Achilles, you may
						take all elsethat was your father's.
						But of those arms another man now is lord, the son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes" authname="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>.’
						The tears came quick to my eyes as I sprang up in passionate anger and said
						in my bitterness, ‘Madman! Have you dared give my armsto another man in my place, without asking me?’ But
						Odysseus—for he chanced to be at hand—said, ‘Yes, boy, they awarded them as
						was just, since it was I who saved the arms and their master by my presence
						at the crucial moment.’ Then immediately, in my fury, I began to lash at him
						with every kind of insultand left not
						one unsaid, if he was indeed to rob me of my arms. At this point, stung by
						the abuse, though not given to anger, he answered,—‘You have not gone to
						where we have; instead you have been absent from where you were
							needed.And since your tongue is
						so arrogant, you will never sail back to Scyros with those arms in your
						possession.’ In that way rebuked, in that way insulted, I sail for home,
						deprived of what is my own by that worst offspring of a wicked line,
							Odysseus.And yet I do not blame
						him as much as I do those in power. For a city hangs wholly on its leaders,
						and so does an army, but when men shatter law and order, it is the lessons
						of their teachers that corrupt them. My tale is told in full. May he who
						hates the Atreidsbe as dear to the
						gods as he is to me!</p>

						you will win the prize of highest honor—if I return alive to Oeta's
							soil.Come, the trouble will not
						last one full day. Endure it, take me and throw me where you will—in the
						hold, the prow, the stern, wherever I will least annoy my shipmates. Say
						yes, by the great god of suppliants, son;be persuaded! I supplicate you at your knees, I am an
						infirm wretch, and lame! Do not leave me desolate like this, far from the
						paths of mankind! No, bring me safely to your own home, or to <placeName key="tgn,7002677" authname="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, Chalcodon's
							seat;and from there it will be no
						long journey for me to Oeta and the Trachinian heights, and fair-flowing
						Spercheius, so that you may show me to my beloved father, though long I have
						feared that he may have departed me. For oftendid I summon him by means of those who came here, sending
						imploring prayers that he would himself send a ship and get me safely home.
						But either he is dead, or else, as I think is likely, my messengers thought
						my concerns of little account and hurried on their homeward
							voyage.Now, however, since in you
						I have found one who can be both an escort and a messenger, save me and show
						me mercy, keeping in mind that all human destiny is full of the fear and the
						danger that prosperity may be followed by its opposite. He who stands clear
						of trouble must beware of dangers,and
						when a man lives at ease, then it is that he must look most closely to his
						livelihood, lest it secretly suffer ruin.</p>

               <p>O day of joy unsurpassed! Most

						made a solemn farewell to my homeless home inside, so that you may also
							learnby what means I sustained my
						life, and how stout of heart I was born. For I believe that the mere sight
						would have deterred any other man but me from enduring these sufferings. But

               <p>Son of Achilles, I asked my companion here, when he was guarding your ship
						with two others, to tell me where you might be found,since I have chanced upon you unexpectedly by the
						good fortune of coming to anchor off this very coast. With no great company
						I am homeward bound on my trader's voyage from <placeName key="tgn,7002329" authname="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> to Peparethus with its
						cluster-laden vines, but when I heard that the sailorswere all of your crew, I resolved not to continue
						my voyage in silence, without first giving you my news and getting the due
						reward. You know nothing, I suspect, of your own affairs: the new designs
						the Greekshave regarding you, and not
						only designs, but deeds in progress and no longer postponed.</p>

               <p>The service you have done me by your forethought, sir, unless I am unworthy,
						will remain in my grateful thoughts. But tell me just what the designs are
						that you mentioned, so that I may understandwhat is the strange plan of the Greeks that you know.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merchant</speaker>
               <p>Then do not question me further, but get yourself out of here as quickly as

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
               <p>His meaning yet eludes me. But,

               <p>I am the enemy of the Atreids, and

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merchant</speaker>
               <p>Beware of what you are doing, boy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
               <p>I am well aware.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merchant</speaker>
               <p>I will hold you accountable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
               <p>Do so, but speak.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merchant</speaker>
               <p>I will. It is after this man that those two whom I named to you, Diomedes and
						forceful Odysseus, are sailing. They are oath-bound to retrieve him, either
						by winning words or by overpowering might.And all the Achaeans heard this clearly from the mouth
						Odysseus, for his confidence of success in this action was higher than his
						comrade's.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
               <p>And for the sake of what did the Atreids after so long a time turn their
						thoughts so urgently towards this man,whom they were long since keeping an outcast? What was the desire that
						came over them, or what force? What avenging spirit sent by the gods to
						exact payment for evil deeds?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merchant</speaker>
               <p>I will inform you of all that, since it seems that you have not heard. There
						was a seer of noble birth,a son of
						Priam, called Helenus, whom that man, out on a solitary night raid—that
						deceitful Odysseus, whose repute is all shame and dishonor—captured. Leading
						him back in bonds, he displayed him publicly to the Achaeans as his glorious
							prey.Helenus then prophesied for
						them whatever matter they asked, and, pertaining to <placeName key="perseus,Troy" authname="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, he foretold
						that they would never sack its towers, unless by winning words they should
						bring Philoctetes here from the island where he now dwells. And, as soon as
						he heard the seer prophecy this, <placeName key="perseus,Laertes" authname="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>' sonimmediately promised that he would bring the man
						and show him to the Achaeans. He thought it most likely that he would get
						him willingly, but, if unwilling, then by force, and he added that, were he
						to fail in this, whoever wished it might sever his head.You have heard everything, boy, and I advise speed
						for you, and for any man for whom you care.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
               <p>Alas! Has he, the utter plague, sworn to fetch me back to the Achaeans by
						persuasion? For if that were to happen, I could be persuaded, when dead, to
						come back upfrom Hades into the
						light, as his father did!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merchant</speaker>
               <p>I know nothing about that. But for my part I must return to ship, while for
						you I pray that god may help you in every possible way.<stage>Exit
							Merchant.</stage>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
               <p>Now is it not astounding, boy, that Odysseus would ever have expected by
						means of soft wordsto lead me from
						his ship and show me in the middle of the Greeks? No! I would sooner listen
						to that greatest and worst of my enemies, the viper which made me crippled
						as I am! But there is nothing that he would not say or dare. And now I know
						that he is coming here.Come, son, let
						us be moving, so that a wide sea may part us from the ship of Odysseus. Let
						us go! Good speed in good season brings sleep and rest when toil is
						finished.</p>

						skilled trickery, to give up this bow to them, lest you bring destruction at
						once on yourself and on me, who am your suppliant.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
               <p>Agreed. You have revealed the true
						stock, my son, from which you spring. You are no child of Sisyphus, but of
						Achilles, whose fame was the fairest when he was among the living, as it is
						now with the dead.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
               <p>I delight at your praise of my father,and of myself. But hear what I desire to gain from you. It is true that
						men are compelled to bear the fortunes given by the gods; but when they
						cling to self-inflicted miseries, as you do,no one can justly excuse or pity them. You have become
						savage: you welcome no counsellor, and if someone admonishes you, even if he
						speaks in all good will, you detest him and consider him an enemy who wishes
						you ill. All the same I will speak to you, calling Zeus who guards oaths to
							witness.And you remember these
						words and write them in your heart: you suffer this plague's affliction in
						accordance with god-sent fate, because you came near to <placeName key="perseus,Chryse" authname="perseus,Chryse">Chryse</placeName>'s
						guardian, the serpent who secretly watches over her home and guards her
						roofless sanctuary. Know also that you will never gain relief from this
						grave sickness,as long as the sun
						still rises in the east and sets in the west, until of your own free will
						you come to the plains of <placeName key="perseus,Troy" authname="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, find there the sons of
						Asclepius, our comrades, be relieved of this infection, and, with this
							bow'said and mine, be hailed as
						the sacker of <placeName key="perseus,Troy" authname="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s towers. How I know these things are so ordained, I
						will tell you. We have a Trojan prisoner, Helenus, foremost among seers, who
						says plainly that all this must come to pass, and further,that this very summer must see the complete
						capture of <placeName key="perseus,Troy" authname="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. Otherwise he willingly gives himself over for
						execution, if these prophecies of his prove false. Therefore, now that you
						understand everything, give way graciously. It is a glorious addition to
						your gain to be singled outas best
						of the Greeks—first, for coming into healing hands, and then for taking
							<placeName key="perseus,Troy" authname="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>
						rich in tears, and so winning a matchless renown.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
               <p>Hateful life, why, why do you keep me in the light of day, instead of letting
						me go to Hades' domain?Ah, me, what
						shall I do? How can I ignore this man's words, when he has advised me with
						good will? But shall I yield, then? How, after doing that, shall I,
						ill-fated, come into men's sight? Whom will I be able to talk to? You orbs
						that have watched my every suffering,how could you endure to see me consorting with the sons of Atreus, who
						caused my ruin, or with the accursed son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes" authname="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>? It is not my resentment
						for what has already been done that stings me, rather it is the many
						troubles which I seem to foresee I must suffer at the hands ofthese men in the future. For when the mind
						of men has once mothered wrongdoing, it trains those men to be wrongdoers in
						all else thereafter. And in you, too, I wonder at this. You should never
						yourself revisit <placeName key="perseus,Troy" authname="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and should prevent me from going there, seeing that
						those men have done you outrageby
						stripping you of your father's arms [when, in the suit for the weapons, they
						judged unhappy Ajax inferior to Odysseus]. After that, will you go to fight
						at their side, and compel me to do the same? No, do not do it, son, but, as
						you swore to me, escort me home. You yourself remain in Scyros, and leave
						those evil men to their evil doom.So
						shall you win double thanks from me, as from your father, and you will not
						appear through your service to bad men to be like them in your nature.</p>

               <speaker>Heracles</speaker>
               <p>Not yet, not until you have heard my commands,son of Poeas. Know that your ears perceive the voice of
						Heracles, and that you look upon his face. For your sake I have left my
						divine seat and cometo reveal to you
						the purposes of Zeus, and to halt the journey on which you are departing.
						Hearken to my words.</p>
               <p>First I would tell you of my own fortunes—how, by toiling through and
						enduring so many toils to the end, I have won the glory of deathlessness, as
						you witness.And for you, be sure,
						this fate is ordained, that through these toils of yours you will make your
						life far-famed. You shall go with this man to the Trojan city, where, first,
						you shall be healed of your cruel sickness,and then, chosen out as foremost among the warriors in
						prowess, with my bow you shall sever <placeName key="tgn,7008038" authname="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName>, the author of these evils,
						from life. You shall sack <placeName key="perseus,Troy" authname="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and shall receive from the army
						the spoils of supreme valor to carry hometo the heights of your native Oeta for the delight of your
						father Poeas. And whatever spoils you receive from that army, from them
						carry to my pyre a thank-offering for my bow. And these counsels hold for
						you also, son of Achilles,for you
						have not the might to subdue the Trojan realm without him, nor he without
						you. Rather, like twin lions with the same quarry, each of you must guard
						the other's life. For the healing of your sickness, I will send Asclepius to
							<placeName key="perseus,Troy" authname="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,
						since it is doomed to fall a second timebefore my arrows. But of this be mindful, when you plunder
						the land—that you show reverence towards the gods. Do this because Father
						Zeus regards all else as of less account, and because Piety does not die
						along with mortals. Whether they are alive or dead, their piety does not
							perish.</p>

               <p>Come, then, let me hail this land as I depart. Farewell, chamber that shared
						my watches. Farewell,nymphs of
						stream and meadow, and you, strong pounding of the sea-lashed cape, where
						often in the cavern's inmost recess my head was wetted by the south wind's
						blasts, and where many times the Hermaean mount sent an echoto my sad groans in the gale of my sorrow!
						But now, clear springs and Lycian fount, I am leaving you, leaving you at
						last, though such a hope had never buoyed me! Farewell, sea-wrapped
							<placeName key="tgn,7011173" authname="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>,and send me
						off with sailing fair to my heart's content, send me to the destination
						appointed me by mighty Fate and the will of my friends, and by the
						all-taming god who has brought these things to pass.</p>

						have prayed to the nymphs of the sea to come be the guides of our safe
						return.</p>
