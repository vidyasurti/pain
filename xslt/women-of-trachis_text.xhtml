            <div class="div1">
               <hr/>
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Deianeira</p>
               
               <p class="p">There is a saying among men, put forth long ago, that you cannot judge a
                  						mortal's life and know whether it is good or bad until he dies. <a href="#event-pain_1" id="tragedy-pain_1"></a>But well I
                  						know, even before I have passed away to Hades' domain, that my life is
                  						ill-fortuned and heavy. For I, while
                  						still dwelling in the house of my father Oeneus at Pleuron,
                  						had such fear of marriage as never any woman of Aetolia had. For my suitor was a
                  						river-god, Achelous, who in three
                  						shapes was always asking me from my father—coming now as a bull in visible
                  						form, now as a serpent, sheeny and coiled, now ox-faced with human trunk,
                  						while from his thick-shaded beard wellheads of fountain-water
                  							sprayed.
                  						<a href="#event-pain_2" id="tragedy-pain_2"></a>In the expectation that
                  						such a suitor would get me, I was always praying in my misery that I might
                  						die, before I should ever approach that marriage-bed.
                  </p>
               
               <p class="p">But at last, to my joy, the glorious son of Zeus and Alcmena came
                  							and closed with him in combat and
                  						delivered me. The manner of their fighting I cannot clearly recount. I know
                  						it not, but if there be anyone who watched that sight without trembling, he
                  						might give an account of it. But I, as I sat there, was struck with
                  							terror, lest my beauty should win
                  						me sorrow in the end. But Zeus, Arbiter of Contests, accomplished a good
                  						ending—if indeed it was good. <a href="#event-pain_3" id="tragedy-pain_3"></a>For since being joined with Heracles as his
                  						chosen bride, I nourish one fear after another in my anxiety for him. One
                  						night brings distress, and the next
                  						night, in turn, drives it out. Children, furthermore, were born to us, whom
                  						at the time he looked at only as the farmer looks at a distant field,
                  						visiting it only once to sow seed and once to reap. Such was the manner of
                  						his life, ever sending him to and from
                  						our home in servitude to some master.</p>
               
               <p class="p">But now, when he has risen above those trials—now it is that my fear is
                  						keenest. For ever since he slew the mighty Iphitus, we have been dwelling
                  						here in Trachis, refugees in
                  						the home of a foreign host. But where Heracles is, no one knows. <a href="#event-pain_4" id="tragedy-pain_4"></a>I only know
                  						that he is gone, and has caused me sharp pain for him. I am almost sure that
                  						he has come to some suffering. The interval has not been brief; rather, he
                  						is unheard from ten months already, plus another five. Yes, there has been some
                  terrible misfortune. That
                  						tablet which he left with me before departing suggests it to me. I often
                  						pray to the gods that I did not receive it to my misfortune.</p>

                  <a href="#event-pain_5" id="tragedy-pain_5"></a>Deianeira, my mistress, many are the times already that I have observed you mourning
                  the departure of
                  						Heracles with great weeping and lamentation. But now—if it is proper to
                  						school the free-born with the doctrines of a slave, and if I am obliged to
                  						point out what you should do—how is it that you so abound in sons,
                  							yet you do not send one of them to
                  						seek your husband, especially Hyllus? It would be appropriate to send him,
                  						if he cared for his father's sake that he be deemed to fare well. Here he is
                  						now, dashing to the house in timely stride. So if in your eyes I speak in
                  							season, you can use both my counsel
                  						and the man.</p>

                  						through your own experience!—to that now you are total strangers. Yes, a
                  						young life grows in those sheltered regions of its own, and the Sun-god's heat
                  disturbs it not, nor
                  						rain, nor any wind. Rather it takes up a toilless existence amidst pleasure,

                  						portion of anxious thoughts in the night, fearing for husband or for children.
                  At that point a woman
                  						could understand the burden of my misfortunes by recalling her own

                  <a href="#event-pain_9" id="tragedy-pain_9"></a>As a matter of fact, I have had many a trouble to weep for, but I am going to
                  						speak of one that none of the previous could equal. When lord Heracles was setting out from home on his last
                  						journey, he left in the house an ancient tablet, inscribed with signs which
                  						he had never before brought himself to explain to me when going out on one
                  						of his many labors. He had always
                  						departed as if to conquer, not to die. But now, as if he were a doomed man,
                  						he told me what I should take for my marriage portion, and what share of
                  						their father's land he wished divided for his children. And he fixed the
                  						time for the division, saying that, when he had been gone from our land for
                  a year and three months, he was
                  						fated either to die at that time, or by escaping the end of the period to
                  						live thereafter an untroubled life. That, he explained, was the fate
                  						ordained by the gods to be the end of
                  						the labors of Heracles just as, he said, the ancient oak at Dodona had
                  						once told him through the mouths of the two Peleiades. And it is in the
                  						present time that the truth of these prophecies is coming to pass, so that
                  						they must be fulfilled.<a href="#event-pain_10" id="tragedy-pain_10"></a>As a result I
                  						leap up from sweet sleep in fear, dear maidens, terrified at the possibility
                  						that I must remain widowed of the noblest man of all.

                  							although Heracles had inevitable shafts in his hands, he fell short of
                  							his own sons in the contest of the bow. Next he shouted that Heracles
                  							was a freeman's slave, a broken hulk, and then at a banquet, when his
                  							guest was full of wine, he tossed him from his home.

               <p class="p">Furious at this treatment, when

                  							that had strayed, <a href="#event-pain_13" id="tragedy-pain_13"></a>Heracles seized a moment when the man's eyes were one
                  							place and his thoughts another, and hurled him from a towering summit.
                  							But in anger at that deed, the king, the father of all, Olympian Zeus, sent
                  him away to be
                  							sold, and did not tolerate that this once, he killed a man by guile. Had
                  							he achieved his vengeance openly, Zeus would surely have pardoned him
                  							the righteous triumph. For the

                  							of this girl that Heracles overthrew Eurytus and the high towers of
                  								Oechalia: Eros, alone of the gods, enchanted him into doing those deeds of arms, not
                  							the toilsome servitude to Omphale in Lydia, nor the death to which
                  							Iphitus was hurled. But now the herald has thrust Eros aside and tells a
                  							different tale. Well, when Heracles could not persuade him whose seed
                  							produced the child to give him the
                  							girl for his secret concubine, he devised some petty complaint as a
                  							pretext, and made war upon her fatherland, in which, as the herald said,
                  							that Eurytus ruled. He killed the king, her father, and sacked her city. And
                  now, as you see, he makes
                  							his return, sending her to this house not without consideration, lady,
                  							and not as if she were to be a slave. No, do not expect that; it is not
                  							likely, if his heart has been kindled with desire. On this account, my
                  							Queen, I resolved to reveal to you all that I had heard from that man. Many
                  others were
                  							listening to it, as I was, in the public place where the Trachinians
                  							were assembled, so they can convict him. If my words are unwelcome, I am

               <p class="p">No, I implore you by Zeus whose strikes lightning down along the high
                  							glens of Oeta, do not rob me of a true report! Your words will not fall
                  							on the ears of a cruel woman, nor has she yet to learn the fate of
                  								humanity, how by our nature we
                  							are often inconstant in our pleasures. He does not use good sense, then,
                  							who like a boxer opposes the blows of Eros. For Eros rules the gods as
                  							he pleases, and he rules me as well—that is certain. Why not another
                  							woman, just like me? And so I am
                  							crazed indeed, if I blame my husband because that disease has seized him
                  							or because he was seized by this woman, his partner in a thing which is
                  							no shame to them, and no wrong to me. Impossible! If it was from him
                  							that you learned to lie, it was
                  							not a noble lesson. But if you are your own teacher in this, you will be
                  							seen as cruel when it is your wish to prove kind. No, tell me the whole
                  							truth, since to a free-born man the name of liar attaches like an ugly
                  								stain. If your hope is to
                  							escape detection, that cannot come to pass: many are those whom you told
                  							and who will inform me. And if you are afraid, your fear is mistaken,
                  							since it is not learning the truth that would pain me. But to know it,
                  							what is terrible in that? Has Heracles not all by himself already mated with
                  a multitude of other
                  							women? And never yet has one of them come away with a harsh word or
                  							reproach from me, nor shall this girl, even if she should melt in her
                  							passion. Indeed, I felt a profound pity when I saw her because her beauty has
                  destroyed her life, and
                  							she, unfortunate one, has against her will devastated her fatherland and
                  							enslaved it.</p>
               
               
               <p class="p">Well, those things must go with the wind. But as for you, I tell you, be
                  							dishonest to others, but always speak the truth to me.</p>

                  							my thanks.</p>

                  							think and not without good judgment, I will tell you the whole truth,
                  							and not hide it. Yes, it is just
                  							as this one says. That terrible longing for the girl long ago shot
                  							through Heracles, and for her sake the desolate Oechalia, her father's land, was leveled by his spear.
                  							But he—I must say what is in his favor—he never ordered me to conceal the fact
                  and never
                  							denied it. Instead I, lady, fearing to wound your heart by such news,
                  							erred—if you regard this in any way an error.</p>
               
               <p class="p">Since, however, you now know the whole story, for his sake and for yours equally bear
                  with the woman,
                  							and be willing that the gentle words which you spoke about her have been
                  							spoken unalterably. For though by the strength of his hands he is
                  							victorious in all else, Heracles has been utterly subdued by his passion
                  							for this girl.</p>

                  							you advise. Rest assured that I will not earn another affliction for
                  							myself by waging a fruitless fight against the gods. But let us go into
                  							the house, so that you may carry him my messages and since gifts should
                  							be given in due recompense for gifts received, so that you may take these also.
                  It would not be right

                  							devised, and <a href="#event-pain_21" id="tragedy-pain_21"></a>partly to grieve over
                  						my sufferings in your company.
                  </p>
               
               <p class="p">
                  <a href="#event-pain_22" id="tragedy-pain_22"></a>I have received a maiden—or, I believe, no longer a maiden, but an
                  						experienced woman—into my home, just as a mariner takes on cargo, a
                  						merchandise to wreck my peace of mind. And now we are two, a pair waiting
                  							under a single bedspread for one
                  						man's embrace. Such is the reward that Heracles has sent me—he whom I called
                  						true and loyal—for guarding his home through all that long time. I do not
                  						know how to be angry with him, even though he is infected with this
                  							disease.			 
                  						<a href="#event-pain_23" id="tragedy-pain_23"></a>But, then again, to live
                  						with her, sharing the same marriage—what woman could endure it? For I see
                  						that the flower of her youth is blossoming, while mine is fading. The eyes
                  						of men love to pluck off the bloom of youth, but they turn their steps from
                  						the old. On this account I am afraid
                  						lest Heracles, in name my husband, should be the younger woman's man.
                  </p>
               
               <p class="p">But, as I said, anger brings shame to a woman of understanding. I will tell
                  						you, my friends, the way by which I will have deliverance and
                  							relief. I had a gift, an old one
                  						given to me by a monster of long ago, and kept it hidden in a bronze urn.
                  						While yet a girl, I took this gift from the shaggy-chested Nessus—from his
                  						lifeblood, as he lay dying. He is the one who used to carry men in his arms
                  for hire across the deep current
                  						of the Evenus, using no oar for conveyance, nor ship's sail. He carried me,
                  						too, on his shoulders, when at my father's sending, I first departed with
                  						Heracles as his wife. When I was in midstream, he touched me with lewd hands.
                  I shrieked, and <a href="#event-pain_24" id="tragedy-pain_24"></a>straightaway
                  						the son of Zeus turned round and with his hands shot a feathered arrow that
                  						whistled right through his chest to the lungs. As he passed away the monster
                  						spoke these few words: “Child of aged Oeneus, you will have this benefit from
                  my ferrying, if you obey
                  						me, since you were the last whom I carried. If you gather with your hands
                  						<a href="#event-pain_25" id="tragedy-pain_25"></a>the blood clotted round my wound, at the place where the Hydra, Lerna's
                  						monstrous growth, imbued the arrow with black gall, you will have a charm for
                  the heart of Heracles, so that he
                  						will never look upon any woman and love her more than you.”</p>
               
               <p class="p">Remembering this charm, my friends—for, after his death, I had kept it
                  						carefully locked up in the house—I
                  						have imbued this robe with it, applying to it all that he instructed while
                  						he lived. The work is finished. May deeds of wicked daring always be far
                  						from my thoughts and from my knowledge, as I detest the women who attempt
                  						them! But if in any way I may prevail against this girl by
                  							love-spells and the charms used on
                  						Heracles, the means to that end have been devised—unless I seem to be acting
                  						rashly. If so, I will stop immediately.</p>

                  						nor by the blaze at the hearth, until he stands conspicuous before all eyes
                  						and shows it clearly to the gods on a day for the sacrifice of
                  							bulls. For so had I vowed, that if
                  						I should ever see or hear that he had come safely home, I would dutifully
                  						adorn him with this robe and reveal him to the god as a new sacrificer in

               <p class="p">A thing has happened, my friends, such that, if I declare it, it will be a
                  						strange marvel for you to hear. The implement with which I was just now
                  						anointing the festal robe, a white
                  						tuft of fleecy sheep's wool, has disappeared, eaten away by no animal in the
                  						courtyard, but self-devoured and self-destroyed it crumbled down over a
                  						stone slab. But I must tell the story at greater length, so that you may
                  						know exactly how this thing was accomplished.</p>
               
               <p class="p">I neglected no part of the precepts
                  						which the savage Centaur gave me when he was hurting from the bitter barb in
                  						his side; they were in my memory, like the graven words which no hand may
                  						wash from a tablet of bronze. Now this was his order to me, and I obeyed
                  							it: to keep this potion hidden in
                  						inmost recesses always away from fire and untouched by the sun's warm ray,
                  						until I should apply it, newly spread, where I wished. So I had done. And
                  						just now, when the moment for action had come, I performed the anointing
                  						secretly in the rooms of the house with a tuft of soft wool which I had plucked
                  from a sheep of our
                  						home-flock; then I folded up my gift, and laid it, unvisited by sunlight,
                  						within its hollow chest, as you saw. But as I am going back into the house,
                  						I see a thing inexplicable by words and beyond the knowledge of the human
                  						mind to understand. For somehow I
                  						happened to have thrown the ball of wool, with which I had been anointing
                  						the robe, into the full blaze of the sun's rays. As it grew warm, it ran all
                  						into confusion, and quickly crumbled to powder on the ground, like nothing
                  						in appearance so much as the morsels
                  						left by a saw's teeth when wood is cut. It lies just so, fallen. And from
                  						the earth, where it lay exposed, clotted foam seethes up, like the rich
                  						juice of the blue fruit from the vine of Bacchus when it is poured on the
                  						ground.</p>
               
               
               <p class="p">
                  <a href="#event-pain_29" id="tragedy-pain_29"></a>And so I am distraught, and I do not
                  						know to which side my thoughts should fall. I only see that I have brought a
                  						terrible deed to completion. For why or in thanks for what should the
                  						monster in his death-throes have shown good will to me, because of whom he
                  						was dying? Impossible! No, he was enchanting me in order to destroy the man
                  who had shot him. And now too
                  						late I gain the knowledge of this, when it can no longer help. <a href="#event-pain_30" id="tragedy-pain_30"></a>Yes, I
                  						alone—unless my outlook prove mistaken—I, miserable one, shall completely
                  						destroy him! For I know that the arrow which made the wound harmed even the god Cheiron, and that
                  it kills all
                  						varieties of beasts that it touches. Since it is this same black venom in
                  						the blood that has passed out through the wound of Nessus, must it not kill
                  						Heracles also? To my mind, at least, it must. Nevertheless, I am resolved
                  						that, if he is to be brought down, at
                  						the same time I too will die along with him in the selfsame fall. No woman
                  						could bear to live with a reputation for evil, if she cares above all that
                  						her nature is not evil. </p>

               <p class="p">If you need to hear, then I must tell all. After sacking the famous city of Eurytus,
                  he went his way
                  						with the trophies and choice spoils of victory. There is a sea-washed
                  						headland of Euboea, Cape Cenaeum, where he marked out altars and a
                  						sacred grove to the Zeus of his fathers. There I first saw him, to the gratification
                  of my desire.
                  						He was about to make a sacrifice rich in offerings when his own herald,
                  						Lichas, came to him from home with your gift, the deadly robe, in his hands.
                  						This he put on as you prescribed and
                  						then began his offering with twelve bulls, free from blemish, the prime of
                  						the spoil; but altogether he brought a hundred mixed victims to the altar.
                  						At first the miserable wretch prayed with serene soul and rejoiced in his
                  						ornate garb. But when the blood-fed
                  						flame began to blaze from the holy offerings and from the resinous pine,
                  						
                  						<a href="#event-pain_33" id="tragedy-pain_33"></a>a
                  						sweat broke out on his skin and the tunic clung to his sides close-glued at
                  						every joint, as if by a craftsman's hand; there came a convulsive, biting pain
                  in his bones; and then
                  						the venom, like that of some deadly, cruel viper, began to devour him. At
                  						that he shouted for the ill-fated Lichas—who was in no way to blame for your
                  						crime—asking by what plots he had brought that robe. But he, unfortunate one,
                  all-unknowing, said that
                  						he had brought your gift from you alone, just as it had been sent. When 
                  						Heracles heard it, <a href="#event-pain_34" id="tragedy-pain_34"></a>just as a piercing spasm clutched his lungs,
                  <a href="#event-pain_35" id="tragedy-pain_35"></a>he caught
                  						him by the foot where the ankle bends in the socket and threw him at a surf-beaten
                  rock in the sea, causing the
                  						white brain to ooze from his hair, when the crown of his head had been
                  						scattered and his blood with it.
                  </p>
               
               <p class="p">
                  <a href="#event-pain_36" id="tragedy-pain_36"></a>But all the people lifted up a cry of astounded grief when they saw that the
                  						one was frenzied, and the other destroyed; and no one dared to approach the man. 
                  						<a href="#event-pain_37" id="tragedy-pain_37"></a>For he convulsed down
                  						to the ground and up into the air as he shouted and cried out. All around
                  						the cliffs resounded, both the steep headlands of Locris and the
                  						Euboean capes. But when he was exhausted with repeatedly throwing himself on
                  the ground in his anguish and
                  						repeatedly shouting with howls of grief, as he dwelled on his ill-mated
                  						marriage with miserable you and his alliance with Oeneus, which, he said, he
                  						got for himself as the ruin of his life, then from out of the shrouding
                  							altar-smoke he raised his
                  						wildly-rolling eyes and  <a href="#event-pain_38" id="tragedy-pain_38"></a>saw me weeping among his many troops. 
                  						He stared at me and called me: “O my son, come to me. Do not fly from my trouble,
                  not
                  						even if you have to share my death. Come, lift me up and away and above all
                  						put me in a place where no one can see
                  						me. But if you have pity, at least carry me in all speed away from this
                  						country so that I may not die here.” When he had laid this command on me, we
                  						put him onboard ship and brought him just barely to this land,<a href="#event-pain_39" id="tragedy-pain_39"></a>
                  						while he moaned in his convulsions. And you
                  						shall soon see him, either alive or freshly dead.</p>
               
               <p class="p">Such, Mother, are the designs and deeds against my father of which you have
                  						been found guilty. May Punishing Justice and the Erinys punish you for them!
                  						Yes, if it be right, that is my prayer. Right it is, for to my eyes you have
                  rejected the right by killing the
                  						best and bravest of men in all the world, whose equal you will never see

               <p class="p">Yes, with fierce daring. You shall hear, and then you will bear me
                  								witness. When she came alone
                  							into the house and saw her son preparing a deep litter in the court,
                  							with which to go back and meet his father, she hid herself where none 
                  							would see. <a href="#event-pain_49" id="tragedy-pain_49"></a>Falling before the altars, she moaned that they were left desolate, and whenever she
                  							touched any household thing that she, poor lady, had habitually used in
                  							the past, her tears would flow. If, as she roamed hither and thither
                  							through the house, she beheld the form of any well-loved servant, she
                  							wept in misery at the sight, crying aloud upon her own fate, and her childless
                  existence
                  							thereafter.
                  </p>
               
               <p class="p">But when she finished this, I saw her suddenly rush into the bedchamber
                  							of Heracles. I hid in the shadows to keep my observation secret and was
                  							watching over her when I saw her
                  							spread coverings on the bedstead of Heracles. When she had done this,
                  							she sprang up on them and sat in the middle of the bed. <a href="#event-pain_50" id="tragedy-pain_50"></a>Then she broke
                  							out in warm streams of tears and
                  							said: “Ah, my bridal bed and bridal chamber, farewell now and for ever,
                  							since you will never more receive me in these covers as his wife.” She
                  							says no more, but with a vehement hand she loosens her robe where the
                  							brooch of beaten gold lies above
                  							her breasts and bares all her left side and arm. Then I run with all my
                  							strength, and warn her son of her intent. But even in the space between
                  							my going and our return, we find
                  							that she has driven a two-edged sword up through her side to the heart. 
                  							<a href="#event-pain_51" id="tragedy-pain_51"></a>At that sight, her son gave a great cry. For he knew, poor boy, that in
                  							his anger he had driven her to that action. He had learned too late from
                  							the servants in the house that she
                  							had acted without knowledge and at the will of the monster. Then and
                  							there the youth in his misery left no cry of grief unmade as he lamented
                  							over her, nor as he fell to kiss her lips; he threw himself at her side,
                  							loudly moaning that he had rashly
                  							attacked her with a false accusation and weeping that he must now live
                  							orphaned of both alike, of his father and of her.
                  </p>
               
               <p class="p">Such are the fortunes of this house. Rash, indeed, is he who reckons on
                  							tomorrow, or perchance on days beyond it. There is no tomorrow, until today
                  is safely
                  								past.<br/><a class="stage">Exit the Nurse.</a>

               <p class="p">It was foreshown to me by my father far in the past that I would perish by no creature
                  that had the breath
                  						of life, but by one already dead, a dweller with Hades. <a href="#event-pain_77" id="tragedy-pain_77"></a>So this savage
                  						Centaur in death has killed me alive, just as the divine will had been
                  						foretold. And I will show you how later oracles tally with the first and testify to the old
                  prophecy. I
                  						wrote them down for myself from the mouth of my father's oak of many tongues
                  						in the grove of the Selli, who dwell on the hills and sleep on the ground.
                  						The tree said that, at the time which lives and now is, my release from the
                  toils laid upon me would be
                  						accomplished. And I expected prosperous days, but the meaning, it seems, was
                  						only that I would die. For toil comes no more to the dead. Since, then, my
                  						son, those words are clearly finding their fulfillment, you, on your part, must
                  fight on my behalf. You
