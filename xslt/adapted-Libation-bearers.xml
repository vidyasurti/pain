						their thrones,and are lovers even now, as one may judge by what has happened
						to them, and their oath holds true to their pledges. Together they vowed a
						league of death against my unhappy father, and together they vowed to die,
						and they have kept their promise well. But now regard again, you who hear this account of ills, the device for
						binding my unhappy father, with which his hands were manacled, his feet
						fettered. Spread it out! Stand around in a circle, and display this covering
						for a man, that the Father may see—not mine, but he who surveys all this,
						the Sun—that he may see the impious work of my own mother, that he may be my
						witness in court that I justly pursued this death, my own mother's. For I do
						not speak of Aegisthus' death: he has suffered the penalty prescribed for
						adulterers.But she who devised this abhorrent deed against her husband, whose children
						she bore, a burden under her belt, a burden once dear, but now a hateful
						ill, as it seems: what do you think of her? Had she been born a seasnake or
						a viper, I think her very touch without her bite would have caused anyone
						else to rot,if shamelessness and an immoral disposition could do
							so.What name shall I give it, however tactful I may be? A trap for a wild beast?
						Or a shroud for a corpse in his bier, wrapped around his feet? No, rather it
						is a net: you might call it a hunting net, or robes to entangle a man's
						feet. This would be the kind of thing a highwayman might posses, who
						deceives strangers and earns his living by robbery, and with this cunning
						snare he might kill many men and warm his own heart greatly.May such a woman not live with me in my house! Before that may the gods grant
						me to perish childless! Alas! Alas! Sorrowful work! You were done in by a wretched death. Alas!
						Alas! And for the survivor also suffering blossoms. Did she do the deed or not? No, this is my witness, dyed by Aegisthus' sword.
						This is a stain of blood that helps time to spoil the many tinctures of
						embroidered fabric.Now at last I speak his praises. Now at last I am present to lament him, as I
						address this web that wrought my father's death. Yet I grieve for the deed
						and the punishment and for my whole clan. My victory is an unenviable
						pollution.No mortal being shall pass his life unscathed, free from all suffering to the
						end. Alas! Alas! One tribulation comes today, another tomorrow.But since I would have you know, for I do not know how it will end: I think I
						am a charioteer driving my team far beyond the course. For my ungoverned
						wits are whirling me away overmastered, and at my heart fear wishes to sing
						and dance to a tune of wrath.But while I am still in my senses, I proclaim
						to those who hold me dear and declare that not without justice did I slay my
						mother, the unclean murderess of my father, and a thing loathed by the
						gods.And for the spells that gave me the courage for this deed I count Loxias, the
						prophet of ,my chief source. It was he who declared that, if I
						did this thing, I would be acquitted of wrongdoing. But if I refrained—I
						will not name the penalty; for no bowshot could reach such a height of
						anguish.And now observe me, how armed with this branch and wreath I go as a
						suppliant, an outcast for the shedding of kindred blood, to the temple set
						square on the womb of the earth,the precinct of Loxias, and to the bright
						fire said to be imperishable. To no other hearth did Loxias bid me turn. And
						as to the manner in which this evil deed was wrought, I charge all men of
							 in time to come to bear me witness.I go forth a
						wanderer, estranged from this land, leaving this repute behind, in life or
						death.And you have done well. Therefore do not yoke your tongue to an ill-omened
						speech, nor let your lips give vent to evil forebodings,since you have freed
						the whole realm of  by lopping off the heads of two serpents with a
						fortunate stroke.Ah, ah! You handmaidens, look at them there: like Gorgons, wrapped in sable
						garments, entwined with swarming snakes! I can stay no longer.What fantasies disturb you, dearest of sons to your father? Wait, do not be
						all overcome by fear.To me these are no imagined troubles. For there indeed are the hounds of
						wrath to avenge my mother.It is that the blood is still fresh on your hands;this is the cause of the
						disorder that assails your wits.O lord Apollo, look! Now they come in troops, and from their eyes they drip
						loathsome blood!There is one way to cleanse you: the touch of Loxias will set you free from
						this affliction.You do not see them, but I see them. I am pursued. I can stay no
							longer.Then may blessings go with you, and may the god watch benevolently over you
						and guard you with favorable fortunes!Look! Now again, for the third time, has the tempest of this clan burst on
						the royal house and run its course. </pain>
