        <h1>Table to Understand Attributes</h1>
        <div class="instructions">
            <p>The markup for each greek tragedy included attributes to describe each pain event.
                Below is a table containing the keys for each of the attributes and their respective
                meanings.</p>

            <p>As you can see, there are two main classes for attributes - those that are required
                for all pain events and those that are required only for events that have an
                inflictor. </p>
