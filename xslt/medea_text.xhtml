                     While Medea his hapless wife, thus scorned,
                     appeals to the oaths he swore, recalls the strong pledge his
                     right hand gave, and bids heaven be witness what requital she is
                     finding from Jason. And here she lies fasting, yielding her body
                     to her grief, wasting away in tears ever since she learnt
                     that she was wronged by her husband, never lifting her eye nor
                     raising her face from off the ground; and she lends as deaf an
                     ear to her friend’s warning as if she were a rock or ocean
                     billow, save when she turns her snow-white neck aside and softly to herself bemoans
                     her father
                     dear, her country and her home, which  she
                     gave up to come hither with the man who now holds her in

                     She, poor lady, hath by sad experience learnt how
                     good a thing it is never to quit one’s native land. And she
                     hates her children now and feels no joy at seeing them; I am
                     afeard she may contrive some untoward scheme; for her mood is
                     dangerous nor will she brook her cruel treatment; full well I
                     know her, and I much do dread that she will plunge the keen sword through
                     their heart, stealing without a word into the chamber where
                     their marriage couch is spread, or else that she will slay the
                     prince and bridegroom too, and so find some calamity still more
                     grievous than the present; for dreadful is her wrath; verily the man that doth incur

                     But on me hath fallen this
                     unforeseen disaster, and sapped my life; ruined I am, and long
                     to resign the boon of existence, kind friends, and die. For he
                     who was all the world to me, as well thou knowest, hath turned
                     out the veriest villain, my own husband. Of all things that have life and sense we
                     women are the most hapless creatures; first must we buy a
                     husband at an exorbitant price, and o’er ourselves a tyrant set
                     which is an evil worse than the first; and herein lies the most important issue,
                     whether our choice be good or bad. For divorce is discreditable
                     to women, nor can we disown our lords. Next must the wife,
                     coming as she does to ways and customs new, since she hath not
                     learnt the lesson in her home, have a diviner’s eye to see how best to treat the partner
                     of her life.
                     If haply we perform these tasks with thoroughness and tact, and
                     the husband live with us, without resenting the yoke, our life
                     is a happy one; if not, ’twere best to die. But when a man is
                     vexed with what he finds indoors, he goeth forth and rids his soul of its
                     disgust, betaking him to some friend or comrade of like age;
                     whilst we must needs regard his single self.And yet they say we live
                     secure at home, while they are at the wars, with their sorry reasoning, for I would
                     gladly take my stand in battle array three times o’er, than once
                     give  birth. But enough! this language suits not thee
                     as it does me; thou hast a city here, a father’s house, some joy
                     in life, and friends to share thy thoughts, but I am destitute, without a city, and
                     therefore scorned by my husband, a captive I from a foreign
                     shore, with no mother, brother, or kinsman in whom to find a new
                     haven of refuge from this calamity. Wherefore this one boon and
                     only this I wish to win from thee,—thy silence, if haply I can some way or
                     means devise to avenge me on my husband for this cruel
                     treatment, and on the man who gave to him his daughter, and on
                     her who is his wife. For though a woman be timorous enough in
                     all else, and as regards courage, a coward at the mere sight of
                     steel, yet in the moment she finds her honour
                     wronged, no heart is filled with deadlier thoughts than
                     hers.

                     remark, but oft ere this, how unruly a pest is a harsh temper.
                     For instance, thou, hadst thou but patiently endured the will of
                     thy superiors, mightest have remained here in this land and
                     house, but now for thy idle words wilt thou be

                     rulers, count it all gain that exile is thy only punishment. I ever tried to check

                     angry monarch, and would have had thee stay, but thou wouldst
                     not forego thy silly rage, always reviling our rulers, and so
                     thou wilt be banished. Yet even after all this I weary not of my
                     goodwill, but am come with thus much forethought,

                     with thy sons, thou art cast out. Many an evil doth exile bring
                     in its train with it; for even though thou hatest me, never will

                     base as thee? but yet I will do it, for my questioning will show
                     thee yet more base. Whither can I turn me now? to my father’s
                     house, to my own country, which I for thee deserted to come
                     hither? to the hapless daughters of Pelias? A glad welcome, I trow, would they give
                     me in
                     their home, whose father’s death I compassed! My case stands

                     and those whom I need ne’er have wronged I have made mine
                     enemies to pleasure thee. Wherefore to reward me for this thou
                     hast made me doubly blest in the eyes of many a wife in Hellas; and in thee I own
                     a peerless, trusty lord.
                     O woe is me, if indeed I am to be cast forth an exile from the
                     land, without one friend; one lone woman with her babes forlorn!
                     Yea, a fine reproach to thee in thy bridal hour, that thy children and the wife who
                     saved
                     thy life are beggars and vagabonds! O Zeus! why hast thou

                     is

                     now will I explain to thee my plans in full; do not expect
                     to hear a pleasant tale. A servant of mine will I to Jason send and crave an interview;

                     hostile land for foes to flout, but that I may slay the
                     king’s daughter by guile. For I will send them with gifts in

                     them from banishment, a robe of finest woof and a chaplet of

                     shudder at the deed I must do next; for I will slay the

                     father’s home, persuaded by that Hellene’s words, who now
                     shall pay the penalty, so help me God. Never shall he see
                     again alive the children I bore to him, nor from his new bride shall he beget
                     issue, for she must die a hideous death, slain by my drugs.

                     enough to save herself from falling to the ground. An aged
                     dame, one of her company, thinking belike it was a fit from
                     Pan or some god sent, raised a cry
                     of prayer, till from her mouth she saw the foam-flakes
                     issue, her eyeballs rolling in their sockets, and all the
                     blood her  face desert; then did she
                     raise a loud scream far different fiom her former cry.
                     Forthwith one handmaid rushed to her father’s house, another
                     to her new bridegroom to tell his bride’s sad fate, and the whole house echoed with
                     their
                     running to and fro. By this time would a quick walker
                     have made the turn in a course of six plethra and reached the goal, when she with
                     one awful shriek awoke, poor sufferer, from her speechless
                     trance and oped her closed eyes, for against her a twofold anguish was
                     warring. The chaplet of gold about her head was sending
                     forth a wondrous stream of ravening flame, while the fine
                     raiment, thy children’s gift, was preying on the hapless
                     maiden’s fair white flesh; and she starts from her seat in a
                     blaze and seeks to fly, shaking her hair and head this way
                     and that, to cast the crown therefrom; but the gold held
                     firm to its fastenings, and the flame, as she shook her
                     locks, blazed forth the more with double fury. Then to the earth she sinks, by the
                     cruel blow o’ercome, past all recognition now save to a
                     father’s eye; for her eyes had lost their tranquil gaze, her
                     face no more its natural look preserved, and from the crown
                     of her head blood and fire in mingled stream ran down; and from her bones the flesh
                     kept
                     peeling off beneath the gnawing of those secret drugs, e’en
                     as when the pine-tree weeps its tears of pitch, a fearsome
                     sight to see. And all were afraid to touch the corpse, for
                     we were warned by what had chanced. Anon came her hapless
                     father unto the house, all unwitting of her
                     doom, and stumbles o’er the dead, and loud he cried, and
                     folding his arms about her kissed her, with words like these
                     the while,  He ceased his sad lament, and would have
                     raised his aged frame, but found himself held fast by the
                     finespun robe as ivy that clings to the branches of the bay,
                     and then ensued a fearful struggle. He strove to rise, but she still held
                     him back; and if ever he pulled with all his might, from off
                     his bones his aged flesh he tore. At last he gave it up, and
                     breathed forth his soul in awful suffering; for he could no
                     longer master the pain. So there they lie, daughter and aged
                     sire, dead side by side, a grievous sight that calls for
                     tears

                  pine been felled to furnish with oars the chieftain’s hands, who went to fetch the
                  golden fleece for
                  Pelias; for then would my own mistress Medea never have sailed
                  to the turrets of Iolcos, her soul with love for Jason smitten,
                  nor would she have beguiled the daughters of Pelias to slay their father and come
                  to live here
                  in the land of Corinth with her husband and children, where her
                  exile found favour with the citizens to whose land she had come,
                  and in all things of her own accord was she at one with Jason,
                  the greatest safeguard this when wife and husband do agree; but now
                  their love is all turned to hate, and tenderest ties are weak.
                  For Jason hath betrayed his own children and my mistress dear
                  for the love of a royal bride, for he hath wedded the daughter
                  of Creon, lord of this land. <a href="#event-pain_1" id="tragedy-pain_1"></a>While Medea his hapless wife, thus scorned,
                  appeals to the oaths he swore, recalls the strong pledge his
                  right hand gave, and bids heaven be witness what requital she is
                  finding from Jason. And here she lies fasting, yielding her body
                  to her grief, wasting away in tears ever since she learnt
                  that she was wronged by her husband, never lifting her eye nor
                  raising her face from off the ground; and she lends as deaf an
                  ear to her friend’s warning as if she were a rock or ocean
                  billow, save when she turns her snow-white neck aside and softly to herself bemoans
                  her father
                  dear, her country and her home, which  she
                  gave up to come hither with the man who now holds her in
                  dishonour. <a href="#event-pain_2" id="tragedy-pain_2"></a>She, poor lady, hath by sad experience learnt how
                  good a thing it is never to quit one’s native land. And she
                  hates her children now and feels no joy at seeing them; I am
                  afeard she may contrive some untoward scheme; for her mood is
                  dangerous nor will she brook her cruel treatment; full well I
                  know her, and I much do dread that she will plunge the keen sword through
                  their heart, stealing without a word into the chamber where
                  their marriage couch is spread, or else that she will slay the
                  prince and bridegroom too, and so find some calamity still more
                  grievous than the present; for dreadful is her wrath; verily the man that doth incur
                  her hate
                  will have no easy task to raise o’er her a song of triumph. Lo!
                  where her sons come hither from their childish sports; little
                  they reck of their mother’s woes, for the soul of the young is
                  no inend to sorrow.

               <p class="p">From the house I have come
                  forth, Corinthian ladies, for fear lest you be blaming me; for well I know that amongst
                  men
                  many by showing pride have gotten them  an
                  ill name and a reputation for indifference, both those who shun
                  men’s gaze and those who move amid the stranger crowd, and
                  likewise they who choose a quiet walk in life. For there is no
                  just discernment in the eyes of men, for they, or ever they have surely learnt
                  their neighbour’s heart, loathe him at first sight, though never
                  wronged by him; and so a stranger most of all should adopt a
                  city’s views; nor do I commend that citizen, who, in the
                  stubbornness of his heart, from churlishness resents the city’s
                  will.<a href="#event-pain_14" id="tragedy-pain_14"></a>But on me hath fallen this
                  unforeseen disaster, and sapped my life; ruined I am, and long
                  to resign the boon of existence, kind friends, and die. For he
                  who was all the world to me, as well thou knowest, hath turned
                  out the veriest villain, my own husband. Of all things that have life and sense we
                  women are the most hapless creatures; first must we buy a
                  husband at an exorbitant price, and o’er ourselves a tyrant set
                  which is an evil worse than the first; and herein lies the most important issue,
                  whether our choice be good or bad. For divorce is discreditable
                  to women, nor can we disown our lords. Next must the wife,
                  coming as she does to ways and customs new, since she hath not
                  learnt the lesson in her home, have a diviner’s eye to see how best to treat the partner
                  of her life.
                  If haply we perform these tasks with thoroughness and tact, and
                  the husband live with us, without resenting the yoke, our life
                  is a happy one; if not, ’twere best to die. But when a man is
                  vexed with what he finds indoors, he goeth forth and rids his soul of its
                  disgust, betaking him to some friend or comrade of like age;
                  whilst we must needs regard his single self.And yet they say we live
                  secure at home, while they are at the wars, with their sorry reasoning, for I would
                  gladly take my stand in battle array three times o’er, than once
                  give  birth. But enough! this language suits not thee
                  as it does me; thou hast a city here, a father’s house, some joy
                  in life, and friends to share thy thoughts, but I am destitute, without a city, and
                  therefore scorned by my husband, a captive I from a foreign
                  shore, with no mother, brother, or kinsman in whom to find a new
                  haven of refuge from this calamity. Wherefore this one boon and
                  only this I wish to win from thee,—thy silence, if haply I can some way or
                  means devise to avenge me on my husband for this cruel
                  treatment, and on the man who gave to him his daughter, and on
                  her who is his wife. For though a woman be timorous enough in
                  all else, and as regards courage, a coward at the mere sight of
                  steel, yet in the moment she finds her honour
                  wronged, no heart is filled with deadlier thoughts than
                  hers.

                  nature, expert in
                  countless sorceries, and thou art  chafing
                  for the loss of thy husband’s affection. I hear, too, so they

                  husband, and herself with some mischief; wherefore I will take
                  precautions ere our troubles come. For ’tis better for me to incur thy hatred

                  me and caused sore mischief. Wherefore whoso is wise in his
                  generation ought never to have his children taught to be
                  too clever; for besides the reputation they get for idleness,
                  they purchase bitter odium from the citizens. For if thou
                  shouldst import new learning amongst dullards, thou will be
                  thought a useless trifler, void of knowledge; while if thy fame in the city o’ertops
                  that of the pretenders to cunning knowledge, thou wilt win their
                  dislike. I too myself share in this ill-luck. Some think me
                  clever and hate me, others say I am too reserved, and some
                  the very reverse;
                  others find me hard to please and not so
                  very clever after all. Be that as it may, thou dost fear me lest
                  I bring on thee something to mar thy harmony. Fear me not,

                  with princes. <a href="#event-pain_19" id="tragedy-pain_19"></a>Why should I, for how hast thou injured me? Thou
                  hast betrothed thy daughter where thy fancy prompted thee. No, ’tis my
                  husband I hate, though I doubt not thou hast acted wisely
                  herein. And now I grudge not thy prosperity; betroth thy child,
                  good luck to thee, but let me abide in this land, for though I
                  have been wronged I will be still and yield to my

                     me in. Who shall gainsay this? But all is not yet lost! think not so.
                     Still are there troubles in store for the new bride, and for
                     her bridegroom no light toil. Dost think I would ever have
                     fawned on yonder man, unless to gain some end or form some
                     scheme? Nay, I would not so much as have
                     spoken to him or touched him with my hand. But he has in
                     folly so far stepped in that, though he might have checked
                     my plot by banishing me from the land, he hath allowed me to
                     abide this day, in which I will lay low in death three of my
                     enemies—a father and his daughter and my
                     husband too.
                     <a href="#event-pain_23" id="tragedy-pain_23"></a>Now, though I have many ways to compass their
                     
                     death, I am not sure, friends, which I am to try first.
                     Shall I set fire to the bridal mansion, or plunge the
                     whetted sword through their hearts, softly stealing into the chamber where
                     their couch is spread? One thing stands in my way. If I am
                     caught making my way into the chamber, intent on my design,
                     I shall be put to death and cause my foes to mock. ’Twere
                     best to take the shortest way—the way we women are most skilled in—by poison to destroy
                     them.
                     <a href="#event-pain_24" id="tragedy-pain_24"></a>Well, well, suppose them dead; what city will receive
                     me? What friendly host will give me a shelter in his land, a
                     home secure, and save my soul alive? 
                     None. So I will wait yet a little while in case some tower of defence rise up
                     for me; then will I proceed to this bloody deed in crafty
                     silence; but if some unexpected mischance drive me forth, I
                     will with mine own hand seize the sword, e’en though I die
                     for it, and slay them, and go forth on my bold path of
                     daring. By that dread queen whom I revere
                     before all others and have chosen to share my task, by
                     Hecate who dwells within my inmost chamber, not one of them
                     shall wound my heart and rue it not. Bitter and sad will I
                     make their marriage for them; bitter shall be the wooing of it,
                     bitter my exile from the land. Up, then, Medea, spare not
                     the secrets of thy art in plotting and devising; on to the
                     danger. Now comes a struggle needing courage. Dost see what
                     thou art suffering? ’Tis not for thee to be a laughing-stock to the race of Sisyphus
                     by reason of this wedding of
                     Jason, sprung, as thou art, from a noble sire, and of the
                     Sun-god’s race. Thou hast cunning; and, more than this, we
                     women, though by nature little apt for virtuous deeds, are
                     most expert to fashion any mischief.

                  For instance, thou, hadst thou but patiently endured the will of
                  thy superiors, mightest have remained here in this land and
                  house, but now for thy idle words wilt thou be

                  I
                  saved thy life, as every Hellene knows who sailed with thee
                  aboard the good ship Argo, when thou wert sent to tame and yoke

                  the golden fleece, keeping sleepless watch o’er it with many  a wreathed coil, and
                  I raised for thee a
                  beacon of deliver arice. Father and home of my free will I left
                  and came with thee to Iolcos, ’neath Pelion’s hills, for my love was stronger than
                  my prudence.
                  <a href="#event-pain_28" id="tragedy-pain_28"></a>Next I caused the death of Pelias by a doom most grievous, even
                  by his own children’s hand, beguiling them of all their fear.
                  <a href="#event-pain_29" id="tragedy-pain_29"></a>All this have I done for thee, thou traitor! and thou hast cast

                  thou been childless still, I could have pardoned thy desire for
                  this new union. Gone is now the trust I put in oaths. I
                  cannot even understand whether thou thinkest that the gods of
                  old no longer rule, or that fresh decrees are now in vogue
                  amongst mankind, for thy conscience must tell thee thou
                  hast not kept faith with me. Ah! poor right hand, which thou
                  didst often grasp. These knees thou didst embrace! All in vain,
                  I suffered a traitor to touch me! How short of my hopes I am
                  fallen! But come, I will deal with thee as though thou wert my
                  friend. Yet what kindness can I expect from one so
                  base as thee? but yet I will do it, for my questioning will show
                  thee yet more base. Whither can I turn me now? to my father’s
                  house, to my own country, which I for thee deserted to come
                  hither? to the hapless daughters of Pelias? A glad welcome, I trow, would they give
                  me in
                  their home, whose father’s death I compassed! My case stands
                  even thus: I am become the bitter foe to those of mine own home,
                  and those whom I need ne’er have wronged I have made mine
                  enemies to pleasure thee. Wherefore to reward me for this thou
                  hast made me doubly blest in the eyes of many a wife in Hellas; and in thee I own
                  a peerless, trusty lord.
                  O woe is me, if indeed I am to be cast forth an exile from the
                  land, without one friend; one lone woman with her babes forlorn!
                  Yea, a fine reproach to thee in thy bridal hour, that thy children and the wife who
                  saved
                  thy life are beggars and vagabonds! O Zeus! why hast thou
                  granted unto man clear signs to know the sham in  gold, white on man’s brow no brand
                  is
                  stamped whereby to gauge the villain’s heart?

               <p class="p">There is a something
                  terrible and past all cure, when quarrels arise ’twixt those who

               <p class="p">Needs must I now, it seems,
                  turn orator, and, like a good helmsman on a ship with
                  close-reefed sails, weather that wearisome tongue of thine. Now, I
                  believe, since thou wilt exaggerate thy favours, that to Cypris
                  alone of gods or men I owe the safety of my voyage. Thou hast a
                  subtle wit enough; yet were it a hateful thing for me to say that the Love-god constrained
                  thee
                  by his resistless shaft to save my life. However, I will not
                  reckon this too nicely; ’twas kindly done, however thou didst
                  serve me. Yet for my safety hast thou received more than ever thou
                  gavest, as I will show. First, thou dwellest in Hellas, instead
                  of thy barbarian land, and hast learnt what justice means find
                  how to live by law, not by the dictates of brute force; and all
                  the Hellenes recognize thy cleverness, and thou hast gained a name; whereas, if
                  thou hadst dwelt upon the confines of the earth, no tongue had
                  mentioned thee. Give me no gold within my halls; nor skill to
                  sing a fairer strain than ever Orpheus sang, unless therewith my
                  fame be spread abroad! So much I say to thee about my own toils,
                  for ’twas thou didst challenge me to this retort. As for the
                  taunts thou urgest against my marriage with the princess, I will
                  prove to thee, first, that I am prudent herein, next chastened
                  in my love, and last a powerful friend to thee and to thy sons; only hold thy
                  peace. Since I have here withdrawn from Iolcos with many a
                  hopeless trouble at my back, what happier device could I, an
                  exile, frame than marriage with the daughter of the king? ’Tis not because I loathe
                  thee for my
                  wife—the thought that rankles in thy heart; ’tis not because I
                  am smitten with desire fot a new bride, nor yet that I am eager
                  to vie with others in begetting many children, for those we have
                  are quite enough, and I do not complain. Nay, ’tis  that we—and this is most important—may
                  dwell in comfort, instead of suffering
                  want (for well I know that every whilom friend avoids the poor),
                  and that I might rear my sons as doth befit my house; further,
                  that I might be the father of brothers for the children thou
                  hast born, and raise these to the same high rank, uniting the
                  family in one,—to my lasting bliss. Thou, indeed, hast no
                  need of more children, but me it profits to help my present
                  family by that which is to be. Have I miscarried here? Not even
                  thou wouldest say so unless a rival’s charms rankled in thy
                  bosom. No, but you women have such strange ideas, that you think all is well so long
                  as your
                  married life runs smooth; but if some mischance occur to ruffle
                  your love, all that was good and lovely erst you reckon as your
                  foes. Yea, men should have begotten children from some other
                  source, no female race existing; thus would no evil ever have fallen on
                  mankind.</p>

               <p class="p">This speech, O Jason, hast
                  thou with specious art arranged; but yet I think—albeit in
                  saying so I betray indiscretion—that thou hast sinned in casting
                  over thy wife.</p>

               <p class="p">No doubt I differ from the
                  mass of men on many points; for, to my mind, whoso hath skill to fence
                  with words in an unjust cause, incurs the heaviest penalty; for
                  such an one, confident that he can cast a decent veil of words
                  o’er his injustice, dares to practise it; and yet he is not so
                  very clever after all. So do not thou put forth thy specious
                  pleas and clever words to me now, for one word
                  of mine will lay thee low. Hadst thou not had a villain’s heart,
                  thou shouldst have gained my consent, then made this match,
                  instead of hiding it from those who loved thee.</p>
               
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Jason</p>
               
               <p class="p">Thou wouldest have lent me
                  ready aid, no doubt, in this proposal, if I had told thee of my
                  marriage, seeing that not even now canst thou restrain thy soul’s hot
                  fury.</p>

                  ’twas not for the woman’s sake I wedded the king’s daughter, my
                  present wife; but, as I have already told thee, I wished
                  to insure thy safety and to be the father of royal sons bound by
                  blood to my own children—a bulwark to our house.</p>

                  take for the children or thyself to help thy exile, say on; for
                  I am ready to grant it with ungrudging hand, yea and to send
                  tokens to my friends elsewhere who shall treat thee well. If

                     <a href="#event-pain_37" id="tragedy-pain_37"></a>I of wreaking vengeance on those I hate. For where we were
                     in most distress this stranger hath appeared, to be a haven
                     in my counsels; to him will we make fast the cables of
                     our ship when we come to the town and citadel of Pallas. But
                     now will I explain to thee my plans in full; do not expect
                     to hear a pleasant tale. A servant of mine will I to Jason send and crave an interview;
                     then when
                     he comes I will address him with soft words, say, this pleases me, and, that is well, 
                     even the marriage with the princess, which my
                     treacherous lord is celebrating, and add it suits us both, ’twas well thought
                     out
                     ;
                     then will I entreat that here my
                     children may abide, not that I mean to leave them in a
                     hostile land for foes to flout, but that I may slay the
                     king’s daughter by guile. For I will send them with gifts in
                     their hands, carrying them unto the bride to save
                     them from banishment, a robe of finest woof and a chaplet of
                     gold. And if these ornaments she take and put them on,
                     miserably shall she die, and likewise everyone who touches
                     her;  with such fell poisons will I smear
                     my gifts. <a href="#event-pain_38" id="tragedy-pain_38"></a>And here I quit this theme; but I
                     shudder at the deed I must do next; for I will slay the
                     children I have borne; there is none shall take them from my
                     toils; and when I have utterly confounded Jason’s house I will leave the land, escaping
                     punishment for my dear children’s murder, after my most
                     unholy deed. For I cannot endure the taunts of enemies, kind
                     friends; enough! what gain is life to me? I have no country,
                     home, or refuge left. Ο, I did wrong, that hour I left my
                     father’s home, persuaded by that Hellene’s words, who now
                     shall pay the penalty, so help me God. Never shall he see
                     again alive the children I bore to him, nor from his new bride shall he beget
                     issue, for she must die a hideous death, slain by my drugs.
                     Let no one deem me a poor weak woman who sits with folded
                     hands, but of another mould, dangerous to foes and
                     well-disposed to friends; for they win the fairest fame who live
                     their life like me.

                  shared much love. For I have reasoned with my soul and railed

                  distraught, why so angered ’gainst all good advice,  why have I come to hate the

                  he can, in wedding with a princess and rearing for my
                  children noble brothers?  Shall I not
                  cease to fret? What possesses me, when heaven its best doth
                  offer? Have I not
                  my children to consider? do I forget that we are fugitives,
                  in need of friends? When I had thought all this I saw
                  how foolish I had been, how senselessly enraged. So now I do
                  commend thee and think thee most wise in forming this connexion for us; but I was

                  and lent my aid to bring about the match, only too pleased to

                  I was wrong then, but now have I come to a better mind. Come
                  hither, my children, come, leave the house, step forth, and with me greet and bid
                  farewell to your father, be reconciled from all past bitterness
                  unto your friends, as now your mother is; for we have made a

                  tender cheek.</p>
               
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Chorus</p>
               
               <p class="p">From my eyes too bursts
                  forth the copious tear; O, may no greater ill than the present
                  e’er befall!</p>

               <p class="p">Lady, I praise this conduct,
                  not that I blame what is past; for it is but natural to the
                  female sex to vent their spleen against a husband when he trafficks in other marriages
                  besides his own. But thy heart
                  is changed to wiser schemes and thou art determined on the
                  better course, late though it be; this is acting like a woman of
                  sober sense. And for you, my sons, hath your father provided with all good heed a
                  sure refuge, by God’s
                  grace; for ye, I trow, shall with your brothers share hereafter
                  the foremost rank in this Corinthian realm. Only grow up, for
                  all the rest your sire and whoso of the gods is kind to us is
                  bringing to pass. May I see you reach man’s full estate,
                  high o’er the heads of those I hate! But thou, lady, why with
                  fresh tears dost thou thine eyelids wet, turning away thy wan
                  cheek, with no welcome for these my happy tidings?</p>
               
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Medea</p>
               
               <p class="p">’Tis naught; upon these
                  children my thoughts were turned.</p>
               
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Jason</p>
               
               <p class="p">Then take heart; for I will
                  see that it is well with them.</p>
               
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Medea</p>
               
               <p class="p">I will do so; nor will I
                  doubt thy word; woman is a weak creature, ever given to
                  tears.</p>
               
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Jason</p>
               
               <p class="p">Why prithee, unhappy one,
                  dost moan o’er these children?</p>
               
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Medea</p>
               
               <p class="p">I gave them birth; and when
                  thou didst pray long life for them, pity entered into my soul to
                  think that these things must be. But the reason of thy coming
                  hither to speak with me is partly told, the rest will I now
                  mention. Since it is the pleasure of the rulers of the land to
                  banish me, and well I know ’twere best for me to
                  stand not in the way of thee or of the rulers by dwelling here,
                  enemy as I am thought unto their house, forth from this land in
                  exile am I going, but these children,—that they may know thy
                  fostering hand, beg Creon to remit their banishment</p>
               
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Jason</p>
               
               <p class="p">I doubt whether I can
                  persuade him, yet must I attempt it.</p>
               
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Medea</p>
               
               <p class="p">At least do thou bid thy
                  wife ask her sire this boon, to remit the exile of the children
                  from this land.</p>
               
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Jason</p>
               
               <p class="p">Yea, that will I; and her
                  methinks I shall persuade, since she is a woman like the rest.</p>
               
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Medea</p>
               
               <p class="p">I too will aid thee in this
                  task, for by the children’s hand I will send to her gifts that
                  far surpass in beauty, I well know, aught that now is seen
                  ’mongst men, a robe of finest tissue and a chaplet of chased
                  gold. But one of my attendants must haste and
                  bring the ornaments hither. Happy shall she be not once alone
                  but ten thousandfold, for in thee she wins the noblest soul to
                  share her love, and gets these gifts as well which on a day my
                  father’s sire, the Sun-god, bestowed on his descendants. My children,
                  take in your hands these wedding gifts, and bear them as an
                  offering to the royal maid, the happy bride; for verily the
                  gifts she shall receive are not to be scorned.</p>
               
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Jason</p>
               
               <p class="p">But why so rashly rob
                  thyself of these gifts? Dost think a royal palace wants for robes
                  or gold? Keep them, nor give them to another. For well I know
                  that if my lady hold me in esteem, she will set my price above
                  all wealth.</p>
               
               
               
               <p class="speaker">Medea</p>
               
               <p class="p">Say not so; ’tis said that
                  gifts tempt even gods; and o’er men’s minds gold holds more
                  potent sway than countless words. Fortune smiles upon thy bride,
                  and heaven now doth swell her triumph; youth is hers and
                  princely power; yet to save my children from exile I would
                  barter life, not dross alone. Children, when ye are come to the
                  rich palace, pray your father’s new bride, my mistress,
                  with suppliant voice to save you from exile, offering her these
                  ornaments the while; for it is most needful that she receive the
                  gifts in her own hand. Now go and linger not; may ye succeed and
                  to your mother bring back the glad tidings she fain would hear!</p>

                  fond eyes see your mother more, for o’er your life there comes a
                  change. Ah me! ah me! why do ye look at me so, my
                  children? why smile that last sweet smile? Ah me! what am I to
                  do? My heart gives way when I behold my children’s laughing
                  eyes. Ο, I cannot; farewell to all my former schemes; I will take the children from
                  the land,
                  the babes I bore. Why should I wound their sire by wounding
                  them, and get me a twofold measure of sorrow? No, no, I will not
                  do it. Farewell my scheming! And yet what am I coming to? Can I
                  consent to let those foes of mine escape from
                  punishment, and incur their mockery? I must face this deed. Out
                  upon my craven heart! to think that I should even have let the
                  soft words escape my soul. <a href="#event-pain_51" id="tragedy-pain_51"></a>Into the
                  house, children! and whoso feels he must not be present at my
                  sacrifice, must see to it himself; I will not spoil
                  my  handiwork. Ah! ah! do not, my heart, O do
                  not do this deed! Let the children go, unhappy one, spare the
                  babes! For if they live, they will cheer thee in our exile
                  there. Nay, by the
                  fiends of hell’s abyss, never, never will I hand my children over
                  to their foes to mock and flout. Die they must in any case, and
                  since ’tis so, why I, the mother who bore them, will give the
                  fatal blow. In any case their doom is fixed and there is no
                  escape.
                  <a href="#event-pain_52" id="tragedy-pain_52"></a>Already the crown is on her head, the
                  robe is round her, and she is dying, the royal bride; that do I
                  know full well. But now since I have a piteous path to tread,
                  and yet more piteous still the path I send my children on, fain
                  would I say farewell to them.
                  <a href="#event-pain_53" id="tragedy-pain_53"></a>O my babes, my babes, let your mother kiss your
                  hands. Ah! hands I love so well, O lips most dear to me! O noble
                  form and features of my children, I wish ye joy, but in that
                  other land, for here your father robs you of your home. O the
                  sweet embrace, the soft young cheek, the fragrant
                  breath! my children! Go, leave me; I cannot bear to longer look
                  upon ye; my sorrow wins the day. At last I understand the awful
                  deed I am to do; but passion, that cause of direst woes to
                  mortal man, hath triumphed o’er my sober
                  thoughts.

                  <p class="p">Oft ere now have I
                     pursued subtler themes and have faced graver issues than
                     woman’s sex should seek to probe; but then e’en we aspire to culture,
                     which dwells with us to teach us wisdom; I say not all; for
                     small is the class amongst women—(one maybe shalt thou find
                     ’mid many)— that is not incapable of culture. And amongst mortals I do assert that
                     they who are wholly without experience and have never had
                     children far surpass in happiness those who are parents. The
                     childless, because they have never proved whether children grow up to be a
                     blessing or curse to men are removed from all share in many
                     troubles; whilst those who have a sweet race of children
                     growing up in their houses do wear away, as I perceive, their whole life through;
                     first with the thought how they may
                     train them up in virtue, next how they shall leave their
                     sons the means to live; and after all this ’tis far from
                     clear whether on good or bad children they bestow their
                     toil. But one last crowning woe for every
                     mortal man I now will name; suppose that they have found
                     sufficient means to live, and seen their children grow to
                     man’s estate and walk in virtue’s path, still if fortune so befall,
                     comes Death and bears the children’s bodies off to Hades.
                     Can it be any profit to the gods to heap upon us mortal men
                     beside our other woes this further grief for children lost, a grief surpassing all?</p>

                     whom thou didst bear  came with their
                     father and entered the palace of the bride, right glad were
                     we thralls who had shared thy griefs, for instantly from ear
                     to ear a rumour spread that thou and thy lord had made up
                     your former quarrel. One kissed thy children’s hands,
                     another their golden hair, while I for very joy went with
                     them in person to the women’s chambers. Our mistress, whom
                     now we do revere in thy room, cast a longing glance at Jason, ere
                     she saw thy children twain; but then she veiled her eyes and
                     turned her blanching cheek away, disgusted at their coming;
                     but thy husband tried to check his young bride’s
                     angry humour with these words: O, be not
                     angered ’gainst thy friends; cease from wrath and turn
                     once more thy face this way, counting as friends whomso
                     thy husband counts, and accept these gifts, and for my
                     sake crave thy sire  to
                     remit these children’s exile. Soon as she saw the
                     ornaments, no longer she held out, but yielded to her lord
                     in all; and ere the father and his sons were far from the
                     palace gone, she took the broidered robe and put it on, and set the golden crown about
                     her
                     tresses, arranging her hair at her bright mirror, with many
                     a happy smile at her breathless counterfeit. <a href="#event-pain_55" id="tragedy-pain_55"></a>Then rising
                     from her seat she passed across the chamber, tripping
                     lightly on her fair white foot, exulting in the gift, with many a
                     glance at her uplifted ankle. When lo! a scene of awful horror did
                     ensue. In a moment she turned pale, reeled backwards,
                     trembling in every limb, and sinks upon a seat scarce soon
                     enough to save herself from falling to the ground. An aged
                     dame, one of her company, thinking belike it was a fit from
                     Pan or some god sent, raised a cry
                     of prayer, till from her mouth she saw the foam-flakes
                     issue, her eyeballs rolling in their sockets, and all the
                     blood her  face desert; then did she
                     raise a loud scream far different fiom her former cry.
                     Forthwith one handmaid rushed to her father’s house, another
                     to her new bridegroom to tell his bride’s sad fate, and the whole house echoed with
                     their
                     running to and fro. By this time would a quick walker
                     have made the turn in a course of six plethra and reached the goal, when she with
                     one awful shriek awoke, poor sufferer, from her speechless
                     trance and oped her closed eyes, for against her a twofold anguish was
                     warring. The chaplet of gold about her head was sending
                     forth a wondrous stream of ravening flame, while the fine
                     raiment, thy children’s gift, was preying on the hapless
                     maiden’s fair white flesh; and she starts from her seat in a
                     blaze and seeks to fly, shaking her hair and head this way
                     and that, to cast the crown therefrom; but the gold held
                     firm to its fastenings, and the flame, as she shook her
                     locks, blazed forth the more with double fury. Then to the earth she sinks, by the
                     cruel blow o’ercome, past all recognition now save to a
                     father’s eye; for her eyes had lost their tranquil gaze, her
                     face no more its natural look preserved, and from the crown
                     of her head blood and fire in mingled stream ran down; and from her bones the flesh
                     kept
                     peeling off beneath the gnawing of those secret drugs, e’en
                     as when the pine-tree weeps its tears of pitch, a fearsome
                     sight to see. And all were afraid to touch the corpse, for
                     we were warned by what had chanced. Anon came her hapless
                     father unto the house, all unwitting of her
                     doom, and stumbles o’er the dead, and loud he cried, and
                     folding his arms about her kissed her, with words like these
                     the while, O my poor, 
                     poor child, which of the gods hath destroyed thee thus
                     foully? Who is robbing me of thee, old as I am and
                     ripe
                     for death? O my child, alas! would I could die with
                     thee! He ceased his sad lament, and would have
                     raised his aged frame, but found himself held fast by the
                     finespun robe as ivy that clings to the branches of the bay,
                     and then ensued a fearful struggle. He strove to rise, but she still held
                     him back; and if ever he pulled with all his might, from off
                     his bones his aged flesh he tore. At last he gave it up, and
                     breathed forth his soul in awful suffering; for he could no
                     longer master the pain. So there they lie, daughter and aged
                     sire, dead side by side, a grievous sight that calls for
                     tears. And as for thee, I leave thee out of my
                     consideration, for thyself must discover a means to escape
                     punishment. Not now for the first time I think this human
                     life a shadow; yea, and without shrinking I will say
                     that they amongst men who pretend to wisdom and expend deep
                     thought on words do incur a serious charge of folly; for
                     amongst mortals no man is happy; wealth may pour in and make one luckier than another,
                     but none
                     can happy be.</p>
