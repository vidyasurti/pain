# Gendered Pain in Greek Tragedy

## Research questions and theoretical framework
We have a few research questions that guide our markup:
* How do depictions of pain in Greek Tragedies differ between men and women?
* Are depictions of experiencing and inflicting pain in greek tragedies distributed equally among men and women?


We are using a binary definition of gender. Additionally, we are looking at these greek tragedies in a vacuum, not looking at these tragedies in the context of preceding plays.
