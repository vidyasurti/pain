            <h2>Which Greek Tragedies and Why</h2>
            <p>
                We are using four tragedies for our analysis:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Libation Bearers</li>
                <li>Medea</li>
                <li>Philoctetes</li>
                <li>Women of Trachis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The first two plays, Libation Bearers and Medea, were selected because they depict women in pain. Philoctetes and Women of Trachis depict men in pain. This way, we have enough data to make conclusios about women's and men's pain.
