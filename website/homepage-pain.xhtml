            <h2>Research Questions and Theoretical Framework</h2>
            <p>
                Our research questions were central to our methods. Additionally, our research was guided by our understanding of patriarchy and sexism. We wanted to explore whether traditional tropes of sexism exhibited themselves through pain, specifically from the perspective of the original intended audience. By examining how pain is portrayed, inflicted, and experienced, we hope to understand how sexism operates in Greek tragedies. Our exploratory analysis and markup were guided by these research questions:
               
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How do depictions of pain in Greek Tragedies differ between men and women?</li>
                <li>Are depictions of experiencing and inflicting pain in greek tragedies distributed equally among men and women?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We are using a binary definition of gender, and we are looking at the greek tragedies we planned to analyze in a vacuum. In other words, we didn't look at these tragedies in context of the preceding plays.
