            <h2>Research Questions and Theoretical Framework</h2>
            <p> Our research questions were central to our methods. Additionally, our research was
                guided by our understanding of patriarchy and sexism. We wanted to explore whether
                traditional tropes of sexism exhibited themselves through pain, specifically from
                the perspective of the original intended audience. By examining how pain is
                portrayed, inflicted, and experienced, we hope to understand how sexism operates in
                Greek tragedies. Our exploratory analysis and markup were guided by these research
                questions: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How do depictions of pain in Greek Tragedies differ between men and women?</li>
                <li>Are depictions of experiencing and inflicting pain in greek tragedies
                    distributed equally among men and women?</li>
            </ul>
            <p> We are using a binary definition of gender, and we are looking at the greek
                tragedies we planned to analyze in a vacuum. In other words, we didn't look at these
                tragedies in context of the preceding plays. </p>
