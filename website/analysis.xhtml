            <h2>How did the distribution of pain type differ by gender?</h2>
            <!--#include virtual="painType_recGen.svg" -->
            <p>Looking at the numbers, there is a clear dichotomy of pain type by gender. The
                majority of women's pain experiences are of emotional pain, with instances of
                emotional pain comprising around 74% of all pain instances where a woman is
                receiving pain. On the other hand, the type of pain that men experienced was more
                evenly distributed between the three that we delineated, but they experienced
                physical pain most often, which is especially true given that our "both" category
                accounts for simultaneous experiences of physical and emotional pain.</p>

            <h2>Who inflicted pain on who?</h2>
            <!--#include virtual="infGen_recGen.svg" -->
            <p>Interestingly enough, pain was usually inflicted upon
            the opposite gender, with women inflicting pain on men being 
            the most common occurrence. There does not seem to be much of 
            a trend for the mixed gender groups, although that is likely due to the fact
            that only a small proportion of pain instances involved them.</p>
