            <h2>Experiences of Pain by Gender</h2>
            <p>As discussed on the analysis page, there were
            clear associations between female pain receivers and emotional
            pain, and male pain receivers and physical pain. This shows us that the
            pain in these four Greek tragedies is indeed gendered, and gendered in the 
            way that one would expect.</p>
            <p>We additionally marked up "direct" and "indirect" instances of pain, which
            was both a necessity and a way for us to add another layer to our analysis. We wondered
            if perhaps women would experience more indirect pain, since women are stereotypically
            thought to worry more about situations even when they have not directly been hurt. Our results
            did show a slight trendâ€”women were slightly more likely to experience indirect pain than direct pain.
            On the other hand, male receivers of pain were almost evenly split between experiencing direct and indirect pain,
            but there were still 4 more instances of direct pain than indirect pain. This tells us that our hypothesis
            may have been correct, although we would need more data to draw a less tentative conclusion.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics Between Inflictors and Receivers of Pain</h2>
            <p>Our data shows that male receivers of pain were more likely to experience pain
            because of women, while female receivers of pain were more likely experience pain
            because of men. The former trend was particularly noticeable, and this is corroborated
            by the fact that the most common recRel attributes were "husband" and "children," which
            correspond to the infRel attributes of "wife" and "mother."</p>

            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>We started our project a few weeks late because we had to switch topics, which meant
                that we lost some time that we could have had to refine our project and our project
                website. Interpretation and subjectivity are two hallmarks of the humanities, but it
                can be difficult to account for these things in a standardized fashion, and that was
                true for our norm attributes.</p>
