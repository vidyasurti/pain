            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>We started our project a few weeks late because we had to switch topics, which meant
                that we lost some time that we could have had to refine our project and our project
                website. Interpretation and subjectivity are two hallmarks of the humanities, but it
                can be difficult to account for these things in a standardized fashion, and that was
                true for our norm attributes.</p>
