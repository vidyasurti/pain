        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <hr/>

            <h2>Experiences of Pain by Gender</h2>
            <p>As discussed on the analysis page, there were
            clear associations between female pain receivers and emotional
            pain, and male pain receivers and physical pain. This shows us that the
            pain in these four Greek tragedies is indeed gendered, and gendered in the 
            way that one would expect.</p>
            <p>We additionally marked up "direct" and "indirect" instances of pain, which
            was both a necessity and a way for us to add another layer to our analysis. We wondered
            if perhaps women would experience more indirect pain, since women are stereotypically
            thought to worry more about situations even when they have not directly been hurt. Our results
            did show a slight trend—women were slightly more likely to experience indirect pain than direct pain.
            On the other hand, male receivers of pain were almost evenly split between experiencing direct and indirect pain,
            but there were still 4 more instances of direct pain than indirect pain. This tells us that our hypothesis
            may have been correct, although we would need more data to draw a less tentative conclusion.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics Between Inflictors and Receivers of Pain</h2>
            <p>Our data shows that male receivers of pain were more likely to experience pain
            because of women, while female receivers of pain were more likely experience pain
            because of men. The former trend was particularly noticeable, and this is corroborated
            by the fact that the most common recRel attributes in our data were "husband" and "children," which
            correspond to the infRel attributes of "wife" and "mother."</p>
            <p>One reason for the prominence of this trend is that out of the four Greek tragedies we analyzed,
            Medea and Women of Trachis had the largest numbers of pain instances, and both plays feature a woman
            as one of the main characters—Medea in Medea, and Deianeira in Women of Trachis. There are several instances
            when Medea hurts her children, and a large part of the Women of Trachis storyline is about the consequences of
            Deianeira inadvertently causing harm to her husband Heracles. This aligns with the fact that women have often been
            portrayed in familial contexts in fiction, rather than situations outside of family and home.</p>
            <p>Our third most common recRel and infRel attribute values was "lover," which appeared together in
            21 pain instances. 13 of these instances were men inflicting pain upon women, so we can see that the
            four Greek tragedies we analyzed, men also inflict pain to the people they are close to. However, the correlation
            is weaker, which reveals a dichotomy where male inflictors of pain are more likely to be in a wider variety of situations, while
            female inflictors of pain are more likely to appear in familial situations than others.</p>

            <h2>Norms</h2>
            <p>An interesting data point was
                looking at woman inflictors. For inflictors who were women, there were 82 instances across all tragedies where she didn't fit the norm, and there
                was 2 instances where she did fit the norm. Looking at this data, the Greek tragedies we used tended to have women looked down upon against societal norms generally.</p>
            <p>However, we must note that we didn't research ancient Greek culture as extensively for this project to create a broad set of norms. 
                For this project, we decided that who fit the norm and who didn't was more subjective based on the characters of the play. 
                For example, Medea clearly didn't fit the norms of Corinthian society, since she was an outsider.

            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>We started our project a few weeks late because we had to switch topics, which meant
                that we lost some time that we could have had to refine our project and our project
                website. We did not standardize our infRel and recRel attributes, which is something
                that may have helped with collecting clearer data, and we did not check each other's markup for
                interpretive consistency across tragedies. <!-- Interpretation and subjectivity are two hallmarks of the humanities, but it
                can be difficult to account for these things in a standardized fashion, and that was
                true for our norm attributes. --></p>
            <p>Furthermore, the conclusions we have drawn are limited by the fact that our corpus only consisted of four
            Greek tragedies. Extending our analysis to more Greek tragedies would allow us to be more certain about
            the patterns that we have observed and whether they hold true for Greek tragedies in general.</p>
