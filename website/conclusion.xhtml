            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>We started our project a few weeks late because 
                we had to switch topics, which meant that we lost some time that we
                could have had to refine our project and our project website. Interpretation
                and subjectivity are two hallmarks of the humanities, but it can be difficult to
                account for these things in a standardized fashion, and that was true for our
                norm attributes.</p>
